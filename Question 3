window/tab containing a DOM document where as document object is property of window object that

         Screen is the window property that holds information of browser screen.
 It refers to screen object associated with that window object.Used to display
 screen width, height, colorDepth, pixelDepth etc Similar to document screen 
 can be accessed either by window.screen or screen object directly. 
 Screen object doesn't have any methods as in window and document objects.

         

Window Object:
             The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser
 window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen 
 to display the contents of the document, the window object is created.The document object is your
 html, aspx, php, or other document that will be loaded into the browser. The document actually gets
 loaded inside the window object and has properties available to it like title, URL, cookie, etc.
 What does this really mean? That means if you want to access a property for the window it is window.property,
 if it is document it is window.document.property which is also available in short as document.property.
